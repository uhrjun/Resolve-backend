##Simple proof of concept issue tracker I wrote to learn the fundamentals of rest API design, Django & React. 

###Put together rather quickly to for the sole purpose of learning 
###Todos that I'd like to implement sooner rather than later in order
1. Refactor some of the code, optimize imports and make it responsive.
2. Simple dashboard for some basic datavis.
3. Refactor the auth system and make a new custom one the way I want.
4. React native and electron bundles.
