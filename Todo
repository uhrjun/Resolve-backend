Refactor auth 
- Rip out JWT implement session auth and persistent cookie (maybe encrypt?)
- Maybe take a look at the nested serializers again if needed (doubt Im changing that)
- Remove dj_rest_auth and implement auth and autho from scratch with input sanitization 
- Maybe use a lib for Oauth or do it from scratch 

Refactor userform
- Add oauth recievers

Replace react-modal, react-styled-modal with scratch

Add atomics

Add vanilla css/scss

Make responsive 

Maybe native (Maybe!)
